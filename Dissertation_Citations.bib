	abstract = {In February 2018, the United States enacted significant financial incentives for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) that will make capture from the lowest-capture-cost sources economically viable. The largest existing low-capture-cost opportunity is from ethanol fermentation at biorefineries in the Midwest. An impediment to deployment of carbon capture at ethanol biorefineries is that most are not close to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) fields or other suitable geological formations in which the carbon dioxide could be stored. Therefore, we analyze the viability of a pipeline network to transport carbon dioxide from Midwest ethanol biorefineries to the Permian Basin in Texas, which has the greatest current carbon dioxide demand for EOR and large potential for expansion. We estimate capture and transport costs and perform economic analysis for networks under three pipeline financing scenarios representing different combinations of commercial and government finance. Without government finance, we find that a network earning commercial rates of return would not be viable. With 50\% government financing for pipelines, 19 million tons of carbon dioxide per year could be captured and transported profitably. Thirty million tons per year could be captured with full government pipeline financing, which would double global anthropogenic carbon capture and increase the United States’ carbon dioxide EOR industry by 50\%. Such a development would face challenges, including coordination between governments and industries, pressing timelines, and policy uncertainties, but is not unprecedented. This represents an opportunity to considerably increase CCUS in the near-term and develop long-term transport infrastructure facilitating future growth.},

This review paper is focused on analysing the challenges and opportunities that are related to green and blue hydrogen, which are at the basis of different perspectives of a potential hydrogen society. While many governments and private companies are putting significant resources on the development of hydrogen technologies, there still remains a high number of unsolved issues, including technical challenges, economic and geopolitical implications. The hydrogen supply chain includes a large number of steps, resulting in additional energy losses, and while much focus is put on hydrogen generation costs, its transport and storage should not be neglected. A low-carbon hydrogen economy offers promising opportunities not only to fight climate change, but also to enhance energy security and develop local industries in many countries. However, to face the huge challenges of a transition towards a zero-carbon energy system, all available technologies should be allowed to contribute based on measurable indicators, which require a strong international consensus based on transparent standards and targets.},

We determine the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), considering historical weather data for speciﬁc locations to model our PV system, and optimize its size compared to the electrolyzer.

	abstract = {Airports and nearby areas are currently facing an increasing pollution due to the growth of air transport traffic. Airport air pollution is produced not only by aircraft during landing and take-off cycles but also by the ground support equipment (GSE) during the airport handling activities. This paper investigates the potential of hydrogen as an alternative fuel for GSE vehicles to mitigate the airport air pollution. For this purpose, a methodology is developed to assess the environmental benefits attainable with the introduction of hydrogen technology for GSE vehicles powered by proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. This methodology compares, for a given scenario, the direct emissions produced by fuel combustion and the indirect emissions related to fuel production for both diesel and hydrogen technologies. Steam methane reforming and electrolysis technologies are investigated for the production of gaseous hydrogen at the airport. The pollutants investigated comprise carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, particulate matter and volatile organic compounds. The main inputs for the methodology are the number of air transport movements, the aircraft fleet mix, the turnaround times for handling operations, the type of GSEs used, and the ratio of GSE vehicles converted to hydrogen (type, power installed, etc.). A preliminary cost analysis of a ground power unit powered by PEM fuel cells is also presented. The airport planners and policy makers can use this study to define a feasible environmental policy based on the use of new technologies such as hydrogen.},

Here we show that DAC could provide up to 3 GtCO2 yr−1 of negative emissions by 2035—equivalent to 7\% of 2019 global CO2 emissions—based on current-day assumptions regarding price and performance. DAC in particular could exacerbate demand for energy and water, yet it would avoid the most severe market-mediated effects of land-use competition from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation. This could result in staple food crop prices rising by approximately fivefold relative to 2010 levels in many parts of the Global South, raising equity concerns about the deployment of NETs. These results highlight that delays in aggressive global mitigation action greatly increase the requirement for DAC to meet climate targets, and correspondingly, energy and water impacts.},

	abstract = {Humanity has entered a new phase of sustainability challenges, the Anthropocene, in which human development has reached a scale where it affects vital planetary processes. Under the pressure from a quadruple squeeze—from population and development pressures, the anthropogenic climate crisis, the anthropogenic ecosystem crisis, and the risk of deleterious tipping points in the Earth system—the degrees of freedom for sustainable human exploitation of planet Earth are severely restrained. It is in this reality that a new green revolution in world food production needs to occur, to attain food security and human development over the coming decades. Global freshwater resources are, and will increasingly be, a fundamental limiting factor in feeding the world. Current water vulnerabilities in the regions in most need of large agricultural productivity improvements are projected to increase under the pressure from global environmental change. The sustainability challenge for world agriculture has to be set within the new global sustainability context. We present new proposed sustainability criteria for world agriculture, where world food production systems are transformed in order to allow humanity to stay within the safe operating space of planetary boundaries. In order to secure global resilience and thereby raise the chances of planet Earth to remain in the current desired state, conducive for human development on the long-term, these planetary boundaries need to be respected. This calls for a triply green revolution, which not only more than doubles food production in many regions of the world, but which also is environmentally sustainable, and invests in the untapped opportunities to use green water in rainfed agriculture as a key source of future productivity enhancement. To achieve such a global transformation of agriculture, there is a need for more innovative options for water interventions at the landscape scale, accounting for both green and blue water, as well as a new focus on cross-scale interactions, feed-backs and risks for unwanted regime shifts in the agro-ecological landscape.},

	abstract = {Purpose of this project is a) the evaluation of the Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) of jet engines in cruise as a function of flight altitude, speed and thrust and b) the determination of the optimum cruise speed for maximum range of jet airplanes based on TSFC characteristics from a). Related to a) a literature review shows different models for the influence of altitude and speed on TSFC. A simple model describing the influence of thrust on TSFC seems not to exist in the literature. Here, openly available data was collected and evaluated. TSFC versus thrust is described by the so-called bucket curve with lowest TSFC at the bucket point at a certain thrust setting. A new simple equation was devised approximating the influence of thrust on TSFC. It was found that the influence of thrust as well as of altitude on TSFC is small and can be neglected in cruise conditions in many cases. However, TSFC is roughly a linear function of speed. This follows already from first principles. Related to b) it was found that the academically taught optimum flight speed (1.316 times minimum drag speed) for maximum range of jet airplanes is inaccurate, because the derivation is based on the unrealistic assumption of TSFC being constant with speed. Taking account of the influence of speed on TSFC and on drag, the optimum flight speed is only about 1.05 to 1.11 the minimum drag speed depending on aircraft weight. The amount of actual engine data was extremely limited in this project and the results will, therefore, only be as accurate as the input data. Results may only have a limited universal validity, because only four jet engine types were analyzed. One of the project's original value is the new simple polynomial function to estimate variations in TSFC from variations in thrust while maintaining constant speed and altitude.},

	title = {Boil-off losses along {LH2} pathway},
	url = {http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1466121/},
	abstract = {Losses along the LH2 pathway are intrinsic to the utilization of a cryogenic fluid. They occur when the molecule is transferred between 2 vessels (liquefaction plant to trailer, trailer to station storage, station storage to pump or compressor, then fuel cell electric vehicles …) and when the fluid is warmed up due to heat transfer with the environment. Those losses can be estimated with good accuracy using thermodynamic models based on conservation of mass and energy, providing the thermodynamic states are correctly described. Indeed, the fluid undergoes various changes as it moves along the entire pathway (2 phase transition, super-heated warming, non-uniform temperature distributions across the saturation film) and accurate equations of state and 2 phase behavior implementations are essential. The balances of mass and energy during the various dynamics processes then enable to quantify the boil-off losses. In this work, a MATLAB code previously developed by NASA to simulate rocket loading is used as the basis for the LH2 transfer model. This code implements complex physical phenomena such as the competition between condensation and evaporation and the convection vs. conduction heat transfer as a function of the relative temperatures on both sides of the saturated film. The original code was modified to consider real gas equations of state, and some semi-empirical relationships, such as between the heat of vaporization and the critical temperature, were also replaced by a REFPROP equivalent expression, assumed to be more accurate. Non-constant liquid temperature equations were added to simulate sub-cooled conditions. It is shown that although trailer depressurization and transfer losses from the receiving vessel during a LH2 delivery may constitute the largest sources of losses, those can be greatly reduced and even eliminated if CFR/DOT regulations are properly applied and if no-vent fill methods are implemented, particularly for a stationary LH2 storage operating at reasonably low pressure (45 psia or so). As such, it is expected that the only remaining boil-off losses for a refueling station would come from the LH2 pump (utilization and idling), pump vessel cool down/warm up, and environment heat transfer. Based on experimental data measured at LLNL on the Linde 875 bar LH2 cryo-pump and results from the model, and extrapolating for refueling stations of various sizes, it can be shown that boil-off losses can vary from 15\% of delivered LH2 for a 100 kg/day, 5\% at 400 kg/day, and down to less than 2\% for stations above 1,800 kg/day (for a system similar to the one at LLNL). Less boil-off is to be expected for LH2 pumps dispensing at 350 bar, so that less than 0.7\% can be expected above 1,800 kg/day station capacities. At last, boil-off recovery solutions are briefly analyzed, including compressors, cryo-coolers and stationary fuel cell. Their economic value is strongly related to the costs of H2 and of the electricity needed to perform the recovery, on top of the initial capital expenditures. Effective boil-off could be reduced to 0.6-1\% for a 2,000 kg/day station if adequate recovery solutions are used.},

Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) offers an alternative negative emissions technology (NET) option. Here we conduct the first inter-model comparison on the role of DACCS in 1.5 and 2 °C scenarios, under a variety of techno-economic assumptions. Deploying DACCS significantly reduces mitigation costs, and it complements rather than substitutes other NETs. The key factor limiting DACCS deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios’ average DACCS scale-up rates of 1.5 GtCO2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300 EJ/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that DACCS can be deployed at scale, and finding it to be subsequently unavailable, leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8 °C. DACCS should therefore be developed and deployed alongside, rather than instead of, other mitigation options.},

	abstract = {In order to facilitate increased renewable energy production, there continues to be a global increase in wind turbine installation. When quantifying the carbon offsets from these installations, the production emissions are rarely accounted for. This paper reports on the embodied carbon emissions from the production of 14 wind turbines, rated between 50 kW and 3.4 MW. The embodied emissions were quantified from emission factors specific to each material involved in manufacture, transport to site, and installation of the turbines. The resulting trend was that higher-rated turbines had greater embodied carbon emissions with one 3 MW turbine incorporating 1046 tCO2eq compared to only 58 tCO2eq for an 80 kW turbine. However, the greater electricity output of the turbines offset these emissions more quickly with a recovery in 64 days for a 3.4 MW turbine compared to 354 days for a 100 kW one. This also resulted in lower carbon emissions per kilowatt hour of electricity generated and quicker payback as a percentage of lifetime of 0.9\% for a 3.4 MW turbine compared to 4.3\% and 4.9\% for a 50 and 100 kW turbines, respectively. The findings of this analysis indicate that a preference for installation of higher-rated, over lower-rated, turbines should be favoured for greater environmental benefits.},

	abstract = {Onshore and offshore wind turbines may have different environmental sustainability due to their own characteristics, and this information is important for future growth of wind power. The paper uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of onshore and offshore wind turbines with the nominal capacity of 2 MW, to advance our understanding of onshore and offshore wind energy and to inform policy, planning, and investment decisions for future growth of wind power. Results show that the life-cycle GHG emission intensity is 0.082 kg CO2-equivalent (eq)/Megajoule (MJ) for onshore wind turbine and is 0.130 kg CO2-eq/MJ for offshore wind turbine, respectively. Offshore wind turbine has larger life-cycle GHG emissions than onshore wind turbine, owing to the floating platform fixed in sea. Onshore and offshore wind turbines have much smaller life-cycle GHG emission intensity than coal power plants. If the installed wind turbines in 2014 displace coal, the saved GHG emissions can roughly reach 5.08 × 107 t CO2-eq, accounting for 0.09\% of global GHG emissions in 2012. The sensitive analysis shows that the lifetime and energy production of wind turbine have large influences on the GHG emission intensity of both onshore and offshore wind turbines, implying that it is an effective way to prolong the lifetime of wind turbine and increase the energy production of wind turbine to reduce the GHG emission intensity of wind turbine. The sensitivity analysis further shows that the distance from wind turbine factory to wind farm site has more significant influence on the life-cycle GHG emission intensities of both onshore and offshore wind turbines than that from wind farm site to the recycling and landfill locations, suggesting that the wind farm site and the wind turbine factory should be as close as possible.},

However, concerns have been raised about its impact on water, as large-scale biofuel production may place pressure on fresh water supplies and water quality. Water footprint (WF) analysis, when combined with water-focused life cycle assessment (LCA), can be an effective system analysis tool for water sustainability. This study developed a life cycle water footprint analysis informed by inputs from multiple models for rapeseed HEFA jet fuel production in North Dakota and evaluated the environmental impacts on water utilization and water quality due to large scale HEFA jet production. The biogeochemical-based EPIC model was incorporated to simulate crop growth that influences the hydrological cycle. Systematic LCA models were built in SimaPro to conduct life cycle blue WF analysis. Results using energy allocation indicate that rapeseed derived HEFA jet fuel has a WF of 131–143 m3 per GJ fuel over a rapeseed price range of \$470–600, including all green, blue, and gray WF components. Discussions also indicate the importance of incorporating allocation within a life cycle approach when conducting biofuel WF analysis.},

	abstract = {Between 2010 and 2050, aviation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are projected to increase 3.6- to 6.2-fold due to rapid sectoral growth, while global GHG emissions should reduce by 40-70\% to realize the climate mitigation ambitions outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Renewable jet fuel (RJF) produced from biomass is one of the main options to structurally reduce aviation-related GHG emissions. However, current consumption of RJF is negligible, mainly due to high production costs. This thesis addresses the production costs, climate impact and future supply of RJF. Chapters 2-5 quantify the production cost and climate impact for a wide range of RJF production systems. Chapter 6 models the future supply of RJF in the EU towards 2030 and analyzes the impact on other bio-based sectors. The production cost of RJF likely remains higher than fossil jet fuel in the short (2020) and medium term (2030). The Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway shows the lowest production costs in the short term, while Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and Pyrolysis provide promising alternatives in the medium term. The average price premium of RJF relative to fossil jet fuel is projected to decline from +217\% to +45\% between 2021-2030, because of increasing oil prices, the commercialization of novel conversion technologies, access to cheaper feedstocks and technological learning. Optimized supply chain design and co-production strategies with existing industries (e.g. pulp mills or refineries) could reduce RJF production costs by up to 20\%. The climate impact of RJF from CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions varies between conversion pathways and production contexts, but can be significantly lower than fossil jet fuel. The majority of investigated RJF conversion pathways reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by more than 70\%, particularly when produced from residues and lignocellulosic crops. The Relative Climate Impact indicator introduced in Chapter 5 shows that time-dependent emissions, associated with land use change, carbon debt and foregone sequestration, can exceed life-cycle emissions and may delay, limit or even eliminate the climate change benefits of RJF. However, the risk of these emission fluxes can be effectively mitigated by shaping the right production context. The future supply of RJF mainly depends on policy incentives, the pace of technology development, and biomass supply and demand. Based on the anticipated regulatory context in the EU between 2021-2030, RJF supply could increase to 165-261 PJ yr-1 (3.8-6.1 Mt yr-1) in the EU by 2030, which covers 6-9\% of EU jet fuel consumption and 53-84\% of projected emission growth. The cumulative costs over 2021-2030 were estimated at €7.7-11 billion, which translates to approximately 11-16 € GJ-1 RJF (491-682 € t-1), 160-222 € t-1 CO2 abated, or 1.0-1.4 € per departing passenger on intra-EU flights. In sum, RJF can reduce the climate impact of the aviation industry in the coming decade, provided 1) RJF producers guarantee robust climate impact reductions, 2) technology developers are supported to commercialize new conversion technologies and reduce costs, and 3) governments and aviation stakeholders develop a structural financing mechanism to cover the cost differential between RJF and fossil jet fuel.},

	abstract = {The introduction of renewable jet fuel (RJF) is considered an important emission mitigation measure for the aviation industry. This study compares the well-to-wake (WtWa) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performance of multiple RJF conversion pathways and explores the impact of different co-product allocation methods. The insights obtained in this study are of particular importance if RJF is included as an emission mitigation instrument in the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Fischer–Tropsch pathways yield the highest GHG emission reduction compared to fossil jet fuel (86–104\%) of the pathways in scope, followed by Hydrothermal Liquefaction (77–80\%) and sugarcane- (71–75\%) and corn stover-based Alcohol-to-Jet (60–75\%). Feedstock cultivation, hydrogen and conversion inputs were shown to be major contributors to the overall WtWa GHG emission performance. The choice of allocation method mainly affects pathways yielding high shares of co-products or producing co-products which effectively displace carbon intensive products (e.g., electricity). Renewable jet fuel can contribute to significant reduction of aviation-related GHG emissions, provided the right feedstock and conversion technology are used. The GHG emission performance of RJF may be further improved by using sustainable hydrogen sources or applying carbon capture and storage. Based on the character and impact of different co-product allocation methods, we recommend using energy and economic allocation (for non-energy co-products) at a global level, as it leverages the universal character of energy allocation while adequately valuing non-energy co-products.},

	abstract = {In the present study, 6-mm ground corn stover and switchgrass were torrefied in temperatures ranging from 180 to 270°C for 15 to 120-min residence time. Thermogravimetric analyzer was used to do the torrefaction studies. At a temperature of {\textgreater}270°C and a 30-min residence time the mass loss increased to {\textgreater}45\%. At 180°C and 120 min there was about 56 and 73\% of moisture loss in the corn stover and switchgrass further increasing the temperature to 270°C and 120 min resulted in about 78.8\% to 88.18\% moisture loss in both the feedstock. Additionally, at these temperatures there was significant decrease in ash and volatile content and increase in the fixed carbon content for both the biomasses tested. The ultimate composition like carbon content increased and hydrogen content decreased with increase in the torrefaction temperature and time. At 270°C and 15 min residence time, the carbon content observed was 54.92 and 53.94\% and hydrogen content observed was 2.74 and 3.14\%. Nitrogen and sulfur content measured at 270°C and 120 min were 0.98, 0.8, 0.076 and 0.07\% for both the corn stover and switchgrass. The H/C and O/C ratio calculated decreased to the lowest values of 0.59 and 0.64, and 0.71 and 0.76 for both biomasses. The van Krevelen diagram drawn for corn stover and switchgrass torrefied at 270°C is closer to coals like Illinois Basis and Powder River Basin. In the present study the maximum higher heating that was observed by corn stover and switchgrass was 21.51 and 21.53 MJ/kg at 270°C and a 120-min residence time. From these results it can be concluded that corn stover and switchgrass, after torrefaction, shows consistent proximate, ultimate, and energy properties.},

Work on Miscanthus yield responses to N, K and S fertilizer will be reported elsewhere, and this study is focused on how fertilisers affected Miscanthus fuel quality. Six different fertiliser treatments were chosen to give interesting contrasts from the field experiment investigating yield responses; nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) at 0, 100, 150 and 250kg N ha−1 in combination with potassium (K as KCl) at 50kg K ha−1 and 150kg N ha−1 also with zero K, and with 50kg K ha−1 (K as K2SO4). A total of 270 samples were taken at five time points over the autumn and winter harvest window in each of the two growth years, 2005 and 2006. Results show that Miscanthus stems have better fuel quality than leaves, with much lower ash, N and S contents, and slightly higher C concentrations and hence higher estimated calorific value. The treatment without any N added into fertiliser seems to give a better fuel quality than other treatments considered in the study, resulting in a fuel with lower N, ash content, and a lower propensity to fouling (as indicated by the indices calculated from its ash analysis), and also higher C concentrations. In general, the late harvested Miscanthus samples have better fuel quality, with lower N, Cl, ash contents, alkali index and slightly higher C contents.},

	abstract = {Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) is one of the technical feasible biofuel technologies. It produces jet fuel from sugary, starchy, and lignocellulosic biomass, such as sugarcane, corn grain, and switchgrass, via fermentation of sugars to ethanol or other alcohols. This study assesses the ATJ biofuel production pathway for these three biomass feedstocks, and advances existing techno-economic analyses of biofuels in three ways. First, we incorporate technical uncertainty for all by-products and co-products though statistical linkages between conversion efficiencies and input and output levels. Second, future price uncertainty is based on case-by-case time-series estimation, and a local sensitivity analysis is conducted with respect to each uncertain variable. Third, breakeven price distributions are developed to communicate the inherent uncertainty in breakeven price. This research also considers uncertainties in utility input requirements, fuel and by-product outputs, as well as price uncertainties for all major inputs, products, and co-products. All analyses are done from the perspective of a private firm. The stochastic dominance results of net present values (NPV) and breakeven price distributions show that sugarcane is the lowest cost feedstock over the entire range of uncertainty with the least risks, followed by corn grain and switchgrass, with the mean breakeven jet fuel prices being \$0.96/L (\$3.65/gal), \$1.01/L (\$3.84/gal), and \$1.38/L (\$5.21/gal), respectively. The variation of revenues from by-products in corn grain pathway can significantly impact its profitability. Sensitivity analyses show that technical uncertainty significantly impacts breakeven price and NPV distributions. Technical uncertainty is critical in determining the economic performance of the ATJ fuel pathway. Technical uncertainty needs to be considered in future economic analyses. The variation of revenues from by-products plays a significant role in profitability. With the distribution of breakeven prices, potential investors can apply whatever risk preferences they like to determine an appropriate bid or breakeven price that matches their risk profile.},

	abstract = {Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus Greef \& Deuter ex Hodkinson \& Renvoize) are productive on marginal lands in the eastern USA, but their productivity and composition have not been compared on mine lands. Our objectives were to compare biomass production, composition, and theoretical ethanol yield (TEY) and production (TEP) of these grasses on a reclaimed mined site. Following 25 years of herbaceous cover, vegetation was killed and plots of switchgrass cultivars Kanlow and BoMaster and miscanthus lines Illinois and MBX-002 were planted in five replications. Annual switchgrass and miscanthus yields averaged 5.8 and 8.9 Mg dry matter ha−1, respectively, during 2011 to 2015. Cell wall carbohydrate composition was analyzed via near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy with models based on switchgrass or mixed herbaceous samples including switchgrass and miscanthus. Concentrations were higher for glucan and lower for xylan in miscanthus than in switchgrass but TEY did not differ (453 and 450 L Mg−1, respectively). In response to biomass production, total ethanol production was greater for miscanthus than for switchgrass (5594 vs 3699 L ha−1), did not differ between Kanlow and BoMaster switchgrass (3880 and 3517 L ha−1, respectively), and was higher for MBX-002 than for Illinois miscanthus (6496 vs 4692 L ha−1). Relative to the mixed feedstocks model, the switchgrass model slightly underpredicted glucan and slightly overpredicted xylan concentrations. Estimated TEY was slightly lower from the switchgrass model but both models distinguished genotype, year, and interaction effects similarly. Biomass productivity and TEP were similar to those from agricultural sites with marginal soils.},

	abstract = {Energy security and climate change mitigation are two of the most significant challenges facing governments in countries across the world. The United Kingdom (UK) government therefore passed the 2008 Climate Change Act that legally commits Britain to reducing ‘greenhouse gas’ (GHG) emissions by 80\% over 1990 levels by the year 2050. Bioenergy (as a potentially low carbon and renewable energy source) is recognised as having the potential to contribute to mitigating GHG emissions and, through utilising domestic biomass resources, can help Britain reduce its reliance on fuel imports and thereby enhance energy security. In order to help guide the UK towards achieving its ambitious targets, a number of forecasting studies have been carried out, each proposing different pathways to securing its 2050 GHG emissions reduction target. The extent to which bioenergy can contribute to future energy supply is appraised, given the biomass resources available to Britain. Analysis of three notable low or zero carbon energy scenario sets developed by, respectively, the British Government’s Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), and the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) enabled a comparative evaluation to be made of each projection and their realism. They reflect alternative modelling approaches that seek to meet the statutory 2050 carbon reduction target (BEIS and UKERC), to that (by CAT) of fully decarbonising Britain by 2030. The spotlight is on the use of dedicated energy crops and their implications, with a particular emphasis on the critical factors and issues of land availability, conversion technologies [including bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS)], and foreign imports. Likewise, the deployment of bioenergy resources may have significant deleterious impacts in terms of direct and indirect land use change, loss of biodiversity and the impairment of eco-system services, and competition with food production. A ‘gap analysis’ leads to recommendations for the improvement of the next generation scenarios and forecasts in order to provide more realistic projections for bioenergy uptake in the UK, although the lessons learned are applicable across much of the industrialised world. It was found that while all three low or zero carbon scenario studies had internal shortcomings from a bioenergy perspective, the analysis by BEIS stood out as having the greatest level of realism due to the account given to many of the critical factors and underlying issues relating to bioenergy uptake.},

Climate impacts can be measured with a metric known as ‘radiative forcing’ (RF) and the total RF of aviation has been estimated to be around 5\% of global anthropogenic forcing (2 – 14\% uncertainty range), of which the non-CO2 effects comprise 50 – 60\% of this 5\% fraction. However, these non-CO2 impacts have a larger scientific uncertainty than the CO2 impacts, particularly for impacts on cloudiness.},

	abstract = {Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, global air transport demand was expected to triple between 2020 and 2050. The pandemic, which reduced global air travel significantly, provides an opportunity to discuss the scale, distribution and growth of aviation until 2018, also with a view to consider the climate change implications of a return to volume growth. Industry statistics, data provided by supranational organizations, and national surveys are evaluated to develop a pre-pandemic understanding of air transport demand at global, regional, national and individual scales. Results suggest that the share of the world’s population travelling by air in 2018 was 11\%, with at most 4\% taking international flights. Data also supports that a minor share of air travelers is responsible for a large share of warming: The percentile of the most frequent fliers – at most 1\% of the world population - likely accounts for more than half of the total emissions from passenger air travel. Individual users of private aircraft can contribute to emissions of up to 7,500 t CO2 per year. Findings are specifically relevant with regard to the insight that a large share of global aviation emissions is not covered by policy agreements.},

	abstract = {Background:  Biomass-derived jet fuel is an alternative jet fuel (AJF) showing promise of reducing the dependence on fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emissions. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) concept is also known as one of the pathways for producing bio jet fuel. HEFA fuel was approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials in 2011, and can be blended up to 50\% with conventional jet fuel. Since then, several HEFA economic and life-cycle assessments have been published in literature. However, there have been limited analyses on feedstock availability, composition, and their impact on hydrocarbon yield (particularly jet blendstock yield) and overall process economics.
Results:  This study examines over 20 oil feedstocks, their geographic distribution and production levels, oil yield, prices, and chemical composition. The results of our compositional analysis indicate that most oils contain mainly ­C16 and ­C18 fatty acids except pennycress, yellow grease, and mustard, which contain higher values and thus would require hydrocracking to improve jet fuel production. Coconut oil has a large content of shorter carbon fatty acids, making it a good feedstock candidate for renewable gasoline instead of jet substitutes’ production. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) was performed for five selected oil feedstocks—camelina, pennycress, jatropha, castor bean, and yellow grease—using the HEFA process concept.
Conclusion:  The resource analysis indicates that oil crops currently grown in the United States (namely soybean) have relatively low oil yield when compared to oil crops grown in other parts of the world, such as palm, coconut, and jatropha. Also, non-terrestrial oil sources, such as animal fats and greases, have relatively lower prices than terrestrial oil crops. The minimum jet fuel selling price for these five resources ranges between \$3.8 and \$11.0 per gallon. The results of our TEA and resource studies indicate the key cost drivers for a biorefinery converting oil to jet hydrocarbons are as follows: oil price, conversion plant capacity, fatty acid profile, addition of hydrocracker, and type of hydropro‑cessing catalysts.},

To reduce the ecological impact of remote airports due to the long-range transportation of kerosene, decentralized on-site production of synthetic paraffinic kerosene is applicable, preferably as a near-drop-in fuel or, alternatively, as a blend. One possible solution for such a production of synthetic kerosene is the power-to-liquid process. We describe the basic development of a simplified plant layout addressing the specific challenges of decentralized kerosene production that differs from most of the current approaches for infrastructural well-connected regions. The decisive influence of the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis on the power-to-liquid (PtL) process is shown by means of a steady-state reactor model, which was developed in Python and serves as a basis for the further development of a modular environment able to represent entire process chains. The reactor model is based on reaction kinetics according to the current literature. The effects of adjustments of the main operation parameters on the reactor behavior were evaluated, and the impacts on the up- and downstream processes are described. The results prove the governing influence of the Fischer–Tropsch reactor on the PtL process and show its flexibility regarding the desired product fraction output, which makes it an appropriate solution for decentralized kerosene production.},

	abstract = {The conversion of H2 and CO2 to liquid fuels via Power-to-Liquid (PtL) processes is gaining attention. With their higher energy densities compared to gases, the use of synthetic liquid fuels is particularly interesting in hard-to-abate sectors for which decarbonisation is difficult. However, PtL poses new challenges for the synthesis: away from syngas-based, continuously run, large-scale plants towards more flexible, small-scale concepts with direct CO2-utilisation. This review provides an overview of state of the art synthesis technologies as well as current developments and pilot plants for the most prominent PtL routes for methanol, DME and Fischer–Tropsch-fuels. It should serve as a benchmark for future concepts, guide researchers in their process development and allow a technological evaluation of alternative reactor designs. In the case of power-to-methanol and power-to-FT-fuels, several pilot plants have been realised and the first commercial scale plants are planned or already in operation. In comparison power-to-DME is much less investigated and in an earlier stage of development. For methanol the direct CO2 hydrogenation offers advantages through less by-product formation and lower heat development. However, increased water formation and lower equilibrium conversion necessitate new catalysts and reactor designs. While DME synthesis offers benefits with regards to energy efficiency, operational experience from laboratory tests and pilot plants is still missing. Furthermore, four major process routes for power-to-DME are possible, requiring additional research to determine the optimal concept. In the case of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, catalysts for direct CO2 utilisation are still in an early stage. Consequently, today's Fischer–Tropsch-based PtL requires a shift to syngas, benefiting from advances in co-electrolysis and reverse water-gas shift reactor design.},

	abstract = {Direct air capture (DAC) separates carbon dioxide (CO2) from ambient air either chemically or physically. As such, it could be a potential climate mitigation tool when paired with geological sequestration of CO2 or downstream conversion to produce products with low life cycle carbon intensities. Of particular interest is the ability to pair CO2 from DAC with electrolytic hydrogen powered by renewable electricity to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons that can be used in transportation (often referred to as “e-fuels”). This presents a pathway additional to electric and fuel cell vehicles to harness renewable electricity for use in the transportation sector and may present an attractive opportunity as costs of renewable electricity and electrolysis equipment continue to fall. We conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a DAC system paired with Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) to produce transportation fuel (i.e., diesel). This is the first LCA study of a DAC-to-fuel process based on data from an operating DAC pilot plant. We estimate the system emits 0.51 gCO2e per gCO2 captured from air or 29 gCO2e per MJ FTS fuel combusted in the baseline scenario, in which the electricity emissions factor used in the process is relatively low. This carbon intensity (CI) is extremely sensitive to changes in the electricity emissions factor. We find that an electricity emissions factor of less than 139 g CO2e per kW h is required for this pathway to provide a climate benefit over conventional diesel fuel. If a low carbon source of electricity is used, this pathway can deliver transport fuels at a CI lower than conventional diesel production and several biofuel pathways. This analysis suggests that fuel synthesis facilities need to be located in regions with very low grid emissions factors, or preferentially, co-located with new-build renewable electricity.},

	abstract = {The effects of increasing water and energy demand pose a growing threat to national infrastructure strategies. Within the UK there is concern that a future lack of water will compromise the UK's current energy policy to meet an increasing demand for electricity by more thermal generation. This paper investigates this by modelling the water demand of the UK's thermal generation in 2030 and 2050 for several future electricity generation pathways. Unlike previous studies this paper has obtained water abstraction and consumption figures specific to the UK. While the water demands were heavily pathway dependent this study finds for the thermal generation pathways there is a serious mismatch between the assumed freshwater available at 2030 and 2050, its expected actual availability, and an understanding of the implications this has for future generation costs. It is shown that a solution is to make greater use of the UK's seawater resource. This study finds the emphasis UK energy policy gives to the competing poles of low cost electricity generation and environmental protection will have significant impacts on the cost and make-up of the UK's future electricity generation portfolio. A companion paper will consider the generation cost issues if seawater is not available.},

Although RFS2 aims to reduce the climate impact of transportation fuels, the policy raises a number of additional environmental concerns, including the water and land resource requirements of alternative fuel production. These factors should be considered in order to determine the overall environmental viability of alternatives to petroleum-derived transportation fuels. Middle distillate (MD) fuels, including diesel and jet fuel, are of particular interest because they currently make up almost 30\% of liquid fuel consumption in the US, and alternative MD fuels could potentially satisfy 21 of the 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels mandated by RFS2 in 2022. This thesis quantifies the lifecycle blue (surface and ground) water consumption footprint of MD from conventional crude oil; Fischer-Tropsch (FT) MD from natural gas and coal; fermentation and advanced fermentation (AF) MD from biomass; and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) MD and biodiesel from oilseed crops, in the US. FT and rainfed biomass-derived MD have lifecycle blue water consumption footprints between 1.4 and 18.1 lwater/lMD, comparable to conventional MD, between 4.1 and 7.5 lwater/lMD. Irrigated biomass-derived MD has a lifecycle blue water consumption footprint potentially several orders of magnitude larger, between 2.5 and 5300 lwater/lMD. Results are geospatially disaggregated, and the trade-offs between blue water consumption footprint and areal MD productivity, between 490 and 3710 lMD/ha, are quantified under assumptions of rainfed and irrigated biomass cultivation.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources can help combat climate change but knowing the land, water and carbon implications of different renewable energy production mixes becomes a key. This paper systematically applies land, water and carbon footprint accounting methods to calculate resource appropriation and CO2eq GHG emissions of two energy scenarios. The ‘100\% scenario’ is meant as a thinking exercise and assumes a complete transition towards bioenergy, mostly as bioelectricity and some first-generation biofuel. The ‘SDS-bio scenario’ is inspired by IEA's sustainable development scenario and assumes a 9.8\% share of bioenergy in the final mix, with a high share of first-generation biofuel. Energy inputs into production are calculated by differentiating inputs into fuel versus electricity and exclude fossil fuels used for non-energy purposes. Results suggest that both scenarios can lead to emission savings, but at a high cost of land and water resources. A 100\% shift to bioenergy is not possible from water and land perspectives. The SDS-bio scenario, when using the most efficient feedstocks (sugar beet and sugarcane), would still require 11–14\% of the global arable land and a water flow equivalent to 18–25\% of the current water footprint of humanity. In comparative terms, using sugar or starchy crops to produce bioenergy results in smaller footprints than using oil-bearing crops. Regardless of the choice of crop, converting the biomass to combined heat and power results in smaller land, water and carbon footprints per unit of energy than when converting to electricity alone or liquid biofuel.},

The Paris Agreement requires that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission sources and sinks are balanced by the second half of this century. Because some nonzero sources are unavoidable, this leads to the abstract concept of “negative emissions,” the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through technical means. The Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) informing policy-makers assume the large-scale use of negative-emission technologies. If we rely on these and they are not deployed or are unsuccessful at removing CO2 from the atmosphere at the levels assumed, society will be locked into a high-temperature pathway.

	abstract = {Biofuel has emerged as an alternative source of energy to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and combat global warming. Biofuels are classified into first, second, third and fourth generations. Each of the biofuel generations aims to meet the global energy demand while minimizing environmental impacts. Sustainability is defined as meeting the needs of the current generations without jeopardizing the needs of future generations. The aim of sustainability is to ensure continuous growth of the economy while protecting the environment and societal needs. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the sustainability of these four generations of biofuels. The objectives are to compare the production of biofuel, the net greenhouse gases emissions, and energy efficiency. This study is important in providing information for the policymakers and researchers in the decision-making for the future development of green energy. Each of the biofuel generations shows different benefits and drawbacks. From this study, we conclude that the first generation biofuel has the highest biofuel production and energy efficiency, but is less effective in meeting the goal of reducing the greenhouse gases emission. The third generation biofuel shows the lowest net greenhouse gases emissions, allowing the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, the energy required for the processing of the third generation biofuel is higher and, this makes it less environmentally friendly as fossil fuels are used to generate electricity. The third and fourth generation feedstocks are the potential sustainable source for the future production of biofuel. However, more studies need to be done to find an alternative low cost for biofuel production while increasing energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Biofuels have attracted a lot of attention due to the increasing demand on energy resources as well as elevated concerns about greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast to other green energy resources, biofuels can provide liquid fuels which are essential for transportation. This review reports recent advances in liquid biofuels, focusing on their generations and types. Generally, biofuels are classified into four generations based on the type of the feedstock that is used. First generation biofuels utilize edible biomass which sparked controversy because it competes with global food needs. Second generation biofuels use non-edible biomass but there are still some limitations related to the cost-effectiveness involved in scaling the production to a commercial level. Third generation biofuels use microorganisms as feedstock, while fourth generation biofuel focuses on modifying these microorganisms genetically to achieve a preferable hydrogen to carbon (HC) yield along with creating an artificial carbon sink to eliminate or minimize carbon emissions. These last two generations of biofuel are still in early development stages. This article reviews and summarizes 124 papers, 77\% of which were published within the last three years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the four liquid biofuel generations as well as the latest development efforts in this field. This review concludes that the current production methods of biofuel in the first and second generations will soon fail to satisfy the increasing demand on biofuel. Therefore, development efforts should be focused on third and fourth generations, specifically the genetic engineering of algae.},

	abstract = {Power-to-liquids are a class of liquid drop-in fuels produced from electricity and carbon dioxide as the primary process inputs, which have the potential to reduce transportation’s climate impacts. We quantify the economic and life cycle environmental characteristics of four electrofuel technology pathways that rely on the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis but produce synthesis gas via different schemes: power-to-liquid (PtL) via electrolysis and a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction; PtL via co-electrolysis; gasification of biomass-to-liquid (BtL); and a hybrid power- and biomass-to-liquid (PBtL) pathway. The results indicate that the hybrid PBtL pathway is the most environmentally and economically promising option for electrofuel production, with results highly dependent on input electricity source characteristics such as cost and emissions. The carbon intensities of electricity generation that must not be exceeded for electrofuels to have lower life cycle emissions than conventional diesel are 222, 116, and 143 gCO2e/kWh for PBtL, PtL electrolysis + RWGS, and PtL co-electrolysis, respectively. We characterize the PBtL pathway in more detail by combining spatially resolved data on biomass cultivation, electricity generation, and cost-optimized hydrogen production from renewable electricity in the United States (US).

	abstract = {This work examines the technical and economic feasibility of Biomass-To-Liquid (BTL) processes for the manufacture of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Six BTL systems are modelled and evaluated which are based on pressurised oxygen gasification of woody biomass, and specifically on circulating fluidised bed and entrained flow gasification systems. Three fuel synthesis technologies are considered: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanol conversion followed by Methanol to Gasoline (MTG) and the Topsoe Integrated Gasoline (TIGAS) synthesis. Published modelling studies of BTL systems based on gasification have only used deterministic estimates of fuel production costs to assess economic viability without accounting for uncertainties of their model parameters. Unlike other studies, the present techno-economic assessment examines and quantifies the effect of uncertainty of key parameters on the fuel production costs. The results of this analysis show that there is a realistic chance (8–14\%) of concepts based on Fischer-Tropsch synthesis meeting the cost of conventional fuels; that this probability could be increased to 50\% with moderate tax incentives (an 8\% reduction in the tax rate); but that deterministic estimates may be systematically underestimating likely production costs. The overall energy efficiency and production costs of the BTL designs evaluated range from 37.9\% to 47.6\% LHV and €17.88–25.41 per GJ of produced fuels, respectively. The BTL concept with the lowest production costs incorporates CFB gasification and FT synthesis. The model deterministic estimates of production costs of this design indicate that a BTL process is not yet competitive with conventional refineries since the biofuel production costs are approximately 8\% higher than current market prices. Large scale biofuel production may be possible in the long term through subsidies, crude oil price rises and legislation.},

This pathway provides a means for producing a sustainable alternative jet fuel (SAJF) from a wide variety of resources, offering a near term opportunity for alcohol producers to enter the SAJF market and for the aviation sector to meet growing SAJF demand. In this article, we review the technical background and evaluate selected variations of ATJ processes. Simulation and modeling is employed to assess some ATJ conversion schemes, with a particular focus on comparisons between the use of an ethanol or isobutanol intermediate. While the utilization of isobutanol offers a 34\% lower conversion cost for the catalytic upgrading process, the cost of alcohol production is estimated to contribute to over 80\% of the total cost at the refinery. The cost of feedstock and alcohol production has a dominant effect on the overall process economics.},

	title = {How green is sugarcane ethanol?},
	abstract = {Biofuels oﬀer one approach for reducing carbon emissions in transportation. However, the agricultural expansion needed to produce biofuels may endanger tropical forests and thus oﬀset the beneﬁts of fossil fuel substitution. Whether this occurs depends on the extent to which increases in biofuels supply arise from gains in yields per acre or expansion in growing areas. I use a dynamic model of land use to disentangle the roles played by acreage expansion and yield increases in the supply of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil. The model is estimated using a panel of 1.8 million ﬁelds, which is built using remote sensing (satellite) information of sugarcane activities. My estimates imply that, at the margin, 94\% of new ethanol comes from increases in area planted and only 6\% from increases in yield. Direct deforestation accounts for 12\% of area expansion. Balancing carbon emissions from deforestation and the carbon saved by fossil fuel substitution, I ﬁnd that it would take about 20 years for the lower emissions from sugarcane ethanol to “pay back” the added emissions from deforestation. As an illustrative policy experiment, I consider the eﬀects of a 5 billion gallon sugarcane ethanol mandate ({\textasciitilde} 3\% of US gasoline consumption). Such policy would lead to a 1\% price increase and deforestation of about 9,000 sq. km. (∼ 3/4 the size of Connecticut).},

	abstract = {Increasing concerns over dependence on fossil fuels instigated the demand for biofuel production over the past two decades, which has led to an increase in competition for productive agricultural land, shifts in land use among different crops, and conversion of land from other uses into biofuel production. These biofuel-induced changes in land use and management can have significant impacts on the environment, which vary widely across landscapes, bioenergy feedstocks, and production practices. Extensive production of conventional first-generation bioenergy crops such as corn (Zea mays L.) and harvest of corn stover for biofuel production increase soil erosion, water and air pollution, and biodiversity losses. It also causes substantial carbon debt due to the release of a greater quantity of carbon dioxide (CO2) from land use changes than the greenhouse gas reductions from the displacement of fossil fuels. In contrast, replacing annual crops with perennial grasses, such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus x giganteus, provides many environmental benefits, such as reduced sediment and nutrient losses, and increased soil carbon levels and biodiversity, and helps in minimizing climate change impacts. However, the use of productive cropland for bioenergy crops could lead to the competition between food and fiber versus fuel. Marginal and degraded lands where food crops may not be profitable and the conservation reserve areas offer the opportunity to develop economically and ecologically sustainable cellulosic bioenergy systems. However, as the market for cellulosic biofuel is under significant pressure due to highly volatile oil prices, biofuel production systems need to be developed as multifunctional landscapes along with conventional cropping systems to maximize ecosystem functions and minimize food versus fuel competition. This chapter provides an overview of biofuel-related changes in land use and management, discusses associated environmental impacts, and describes potential ways to ensure environmentally sustainable biofuel production.},

	abstract = {Global commercial air transportation has grown over the past two decades at a rather stable annual rate of 4.5–5\% in the passenger and 6\% in the cargo segment. Such developments have contributed to globalization of the economy and overall social welfare while at the same time increased impacts on the environment and society in terms of fuel consumption from non-renewable sources and related emissions of GHG (Green House Gases), land use, congestion, and local noise. In particular, further growth of emissions of GHG driven by growth of air transportation demand could contribute to global warming and consequent climate change. This paper, as an update of the author's previous research, investigates the potential of LH2 (Liquid Hydrogen) as a breakthrough solution for greening commercial air transportation. This includes analyzing the main sources of emissions of GHG, their impacts, mitigating measures and their effects – all considered under the conditions of using (conventional) jet A fuel – kerosene – as a derivative of crude oil. Then the characteristics LH2 as an alternative fuel and its effects on the emissions of GHG (particularly CO2) are considered, the latter by using dedicated models and their scenario-based application to the long-term future development of the international commercial air transportation. The results indicate that the gradual replacement of the jet A (conventional) with a LH2-fuelled (cryogenic) aircraft fleet could result in total cumulative emissions of GHG (CO2) stabilizing and then reducing to and below the specified target level, despite further continuous growth of air transportation demand. Thus, greening of commercial air transportation could be achieved in the long-term future.},

            Contrail cirrus account for the major share of aviation’s climate impact. Yet, the links between jet fuel composition, contrail microphysics and climate impact remain unresolved. Here we present unique observations from two DLR-NASA aircraft campaigns that measured exhaust and contrail characteristics of an Airbus A320 burning either standard jet fuels or low aromatic sustainable aviation fuel blends. Our results show that soot particles can regulate the number of contrail cirrus ice crystals for current emission levels. We provide experimental evidence that burning low aromatic sustainable aviation fuel can result in a 50 to 70\% reduction in soot and ice number concentrations and an increase in ice crystal size. Reduced contrail ice numbers cause less energy deposition in the atmosphere and less warming. Meaningful reductions in aviation’s climate impact could therefore be obtained from the widespread adoptation of low aromatic fuels, and from regulations to lower the maximum aromatic fuel content.},

	abstract = {Methane steam reforming (MSR) is the most common and cost-effective method for hydrogen production, and it contributes about 50\% of the world's hydrogen production. Although MSR is a mature technology, it suffers from significant disadvantages such as mass and heat transfer issues and coke deposition during the reaction. Industrially, the MSR reaction is carried out in conventional reactors (CRs) and, in order to obtain a highly pure hydrogen stream, several steps are necessary, such as the reduction of carbon monoxide content in the reformate stream by water gas shift reactors, pressure swing adsorption, and further hydrogen separation/purification devices. Therefore, in order to intensify the whole process, a membrane reactor can be used as alternative solution to conventional systems. In particular, the use of a hydrogen perm-selective membrane inside of a reactor allows the combination of the chemical reaction and hydrogen separation in only one tool. As a result, high-purity hydrogen, methane conversion, and hydrogen production enhancement are obtained as well as the possibility to perform the MSR reaction at milder operating conditions than CRs. Therefore, in this chapter, the relevant progress achieved so far, the most relevant topics of MSR via membrane reactor technology, and the effects of the most important parameters affecting MSR in membrane reactors are described and critically reviewed. In addition, an overview on the mathematical models used for simulating the MSR reaction in a membrane reactor is also presented and discussed.},

Despite ongoing efforts, hydrogen technologies are often assessed focusing on their global warming potential while overlooking other impacts, or at most including additional metrics that are not easily interpretable. Herein, a wide range of alternative technologies have been assessed to determine the total cost of hydrogen production by coupling life-cycle assessments with an economic evaluation of the environmental externalities of production. By including monetised values of environmental impacts on human health, ecosystem quality, and resources on top of the levelised cost of hydrogen production, an estimation of the “real” total cost of hydrogen was obtained to transparently rank the alternative technologies. The study herein covers steam methane reforming (SMR), coal and biomass gasification, methane pyrolysis, and electrolysis from renewable and nuclear technologies. Monetised externalities are found to represent a significant percentage of the total cost, ultimately altering the standard ranking of technologies. SMR coupled with carbon capture and storage emerges as the cheapest option, followed by methane pyrolysis, and water electrolysis from wind and nuclear. The obtained results identify the “real” ranges for the cost of hydrogen compared to SMR (business as usual) by including environmental externalities, thereby helping to pinpoint critical barriers for emerging and competing technologies to SMR.},

	abstract = {Nuclear hybrid energy systems (NHES) have potential to capitalize on (1) producing multiple commodities, i.e. electricity and hydrogen as well as (2) allowing for electricity grid load following, with hydrogen production during low electricity prices. Using nuclear thermal energy and electricity (from the reactor itself) makes hydrogen production an economically attractive option. The reactor can continuously operate at full capacity, sending excess heat and electricity towards hydrogen production, which could either be sold or converted back to electricity using fuel cells at high price times. Several hydrogen production technologies exist, but in this study the focus is on processes that require heat and electricity. These candidates include alkaline water electrolysis, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC), thermochemical sulfur–iodine (S–I), calcium-bromide (Ca-Br) cycles, hybrid sulfur (HyS) and copper–chlorine (Cu–Cl) cycles. Each have different minimum temperature requirements which can be coupled to Generation III and IV reactor outlet temperatures: low (¡300 °C), medium (¡750 °C), and high (¡950 °C). Energy input and material process flow diagrams were created for all technologies at compatible reactor temperatures and compared to the most common commercially operating hydrogen production method: steam methane reforming (SMR). Technology readiness levels (TRLs) and costs were also compared. The TRL of most systems is still below commercial development, and hydrogen productions costs are still too high to be economic without additional policy and/or other developments.},

Hydrogen as an energy carrier for use in airplanes has some unique attributes like global availability, safety, minimum pollution and light weight, making it an ideal fuel.

	abstract = {We have assembled extensive information on the cradle-to-gate environmental burdens of 63 metals in their major use forms, and illustrated the interconnectedness of metal production systems. Related cumulative energy use, global warming potential, human health implications and ecosystem damage are estimated by metal life cycle stage (i.e., mining, purification, and refining). For some elements, these are the first life cycle estimates of environmental impacts reported in the literature. We show that, if compared on a per kilogram basis, the platinum group metals and gold display the highest environmental burdens, while many of the major industrial metals (e.g., iron, manganese, titanium) are found at the lower end of the environmental impacts scale. If compared on the basis of their global annual production in 2008, iron and aluminum display the largest impacts, and thallium and tellurium the lowest. With the exception of a few metals, environmental impacts of the majority of elements are dominated by the purification and refining stages in which metals are transformed from a concentrate into their metallic form. Out of the 63 metals investigated, 42 metals are obtained as co-products in multi output processes. We test the sensitivity of varying allocation rationales, in which the environmental burden are allocated to the various metal and mineral products, on the overall results. Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to further investigate the stability of our results. This analysis is the most comprehensive life cycle comparison of metals to date and allows for the first time a complete bottom-up estimate of life cycle impacts of the metals and mining sector globally. We estimate global direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 at 3.4 Gt CO2-eq per year and primary energy use at 49 EJ per year (9.5\% of global use), and report the shares for all metals to both impact categories.},

	abstract = {The most recent IPCC assessment has shown an important role for negative emissions technologies (NETs) in limiting global warming to 2 °C cost-effectively. However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors’ assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5–3.6 GtCO2 yr−1 for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr−1 for BECCS, 0.5–2 GtCO2 yr−1 for biochar, 2–4 GtCO2 yr−1 for enhanced weathering, 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr−1 for DACCS, and up to 5 GtCO2 yr−1 for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 °C of global warming.},

	abstract = {Negative emissions technologies (NETs) in general and bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) in particular are commonly regarded as vital yet controversial to meeting our climate goals. In this contribution we present a whole-systems analysis of the BECCS value chain associated with cultivation, harvesting, transport and conversion in dedicated biomass power stations in conjunction with CCS, of a range of biomass resources – both dedicated energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, short rotation coppice willow), and agricultural residues (wheat straw). We explicitly consider the implications of sourcing the biomass from different regions, climates and land types. The water, carbon and energy footprints of each value chain were calculated, and their impact on the overall system water, carbon and power efficiencies was evaluated. An extensive literature review was performed and a statistical analysis of the available data is presented. In order to describe the dynamic greenhouse gas balance of such a system, a yearly accounting of the emissions was performed over the lifetime of a BECCS facility, and the carbon “breakeven time” and lifetime net CO2 removal from the atmosphere were determined. The effects of direct and indirect land use change were included, and were found to be a key determinant of the viability of a BECCS project. Overall we conclude that, depending on the conditions of its deployment, BECCS could lead to both carbon positive and negative results. The total quantity of CO2 removed from the atmosphere over the project lifetime and the carbon breakeven time were observed to be highly case specific. This has profound implications for the policy frameworks required to incentivise and regulate the widespread deployment of BECCS technology. The results of a sensitivity analysis on the model combined with the investigation of alternate supply chain scenarios elucidated key levers to improve the sustainability of BECCS: (1) measuring and limiting the impacts of direct and indirect land use change, (2) using carbon neutral power and organic fertilizer, (3) minimising biomass transport, and prioritising sea over road transport, (4) maximising the use of carbon negative fuels, and (5) exploiting alternative biomass processing options, e.g., natural drying or torrefaction. A key conclusion is that, regardless of the biomass and region studied, the sustainability of BECCS relies heavily on intelligent management of the supply chain.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the risks associated with “negative emissions” technologies (NETs) for drawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and storing it in land-based sinks or underground. Modelled mitigation pathways for 1.5 °C assume NETs that range as high as 1000 Gt CO2. We argue that this is two to three times greater than the amount of land-based NETs that can be realistically assumed, given critical social objectives and ecological constraints. Embarking on a pathway that assumes unrealistically large amounts of future NETs could lead society to set near-term targets that are too lenient and thus greatly overshoot the carbon budget, without a way to undo the damage. Pathways consistent with 1.5 °C that rely on smaller amounts of NETs, however, could prove viable. This paper presents a framework for assessing the risks associated with negative emissions in the context of equity and sustainable development. To do this, we identify three types of risks in counting on NETs: (1) that NETs will not ultimately prove feasible; (2) that their large-scale deployment involves unacceptable ecological and social impacts; and (3) that NETs prove less effective than hoped, due to irreversible climate impacts, or reversal of stored carbon. We highlight the technical issues that need to be resolved and—more importantly—the value judgements that need to be made, to identify the realistic potential for land-based NETs consistent with social and environmental goals. Given the critical normative issues at stake, these are decisions that should be made within an open, transparent, democratic process. As input, we offer here an indicative assessment of the realistic potential for land-based NETs, based on a precautionary assessment of the risks to their future effectiveness and a provisional assessment of the extent to which they are in conflict with sustainable development goals related to land, food and climate.},

	abstract = {In order to tackle climate change, a transition to a renewable based energy system is crucial. A renewable based hydrogen economy is one of the possible implementations of such a system. The world receives ample energy from the sun that can be harvested by PV solar cells and, indirectly, by wind turbines. In order to use the most optimal locations for collecting and concentrating energy from these diffuse sources, a long distance transmission network is needed. Mature and semi-mature technologies are available for all parts of the system: from collection to transmission to end-use. In an early stage of development, when new technologies have to win market share from the existing energy system, their development is driven almost exclusively by the reduction of costs per J delivered. However, if a technology should be able to deliver tens to hundreds of EJ, resource constraints can become show stoppers. Many of the newest, most cost-efficient, energy technologies make use of scarce resources and, although they may play an important role in the transition process, they can not be scaled up the level we need for a complete transition. In most cases however other technologies are available that use more abundant materials, be it often at a cost of efficiency. The issue is not only with scarce resources. The sheer size of the energy transition will also challenge the industrial capacity for the mining and production of bulk materials like steel and copper.},

Third, this dire situation places an extraordinary responsibility on scientists to speak out candidly and accurately when engaging with government, business, and the public. We especially draw attention to the lack of appreciation of the enormous challenges to creating a sustainable future. The added stresses to human health, wealth, and well-being will perversely diminish our political capacity to mitigate the erosion of ecosystem services on which society depends.

Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity.

	abstract = {Carbon stocks in vegetation have a key role in the climate system. However, the magnitude, patterns and uncertainties of carbon stocks and the effect of land use on the stocks remain poorly quantified. Here we show, using state-of-the-art datasets, that vegetation currently stores around 450 petagrams of carbon. In the hypothetical absence of land use, potential vegetation would store around 916 petagrams of carbon, under current climate conditions. This difference highlights the massive effect of land use on biomass stocks. Deforestation and other land-cover changes are responsible for 53-58\% of the difference between current and potential biomass stocks. Land management effects (the biomass stock changes induced by land use within the same land cover) contribute 42-47\%, but have been underestimated in the literature. Therefore, avoiding deforestation is necessary but not sufficient for mitigation of climate change. Our results imply that trade-offs exist between conserving carbon stocks on managed land and raising the contribution of biomass to raw material and energy supply for the mitigation of climate change. Efforts to raise biomass stocks are currently verifiable only in temperate forests, where their potential is limited. By contrast, large uncertainties hinder verification in the tropical forest, where the largest potential is located, pointing to challenges for the upcoming stocktaking exercises under the Paris agreement.},

	abstract = {The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s, driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy and the costs of reducing nature's benefits are unequally distributed. The fabric of life on which we all depend-nature and its contributions to people-is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities exist to change future trajectories through transformative action. Such action must begin immediately, however, and address the root economic, social, and technological causes of nature's deterioration.},

The National Footprint Accounts (NFA) are the most widely used Ecological Footprint (EF) dataset, and provide results for most countries and the world from 1961 to 2014, based primarily on publicly available UN datasets. Here, we review the evolution of the NFA, describe and quantify the effects of improvements that have been implemented into the accounts since the 2012 edition, and review the latest global trends. Comparing results over six editions of NFAs, we find that time-series trends in world results remain stable, and that the world Ecological Footprint for the latest common year (2008) has increased six percent after four major accounting improvements and more than thirty minor improvements. The latest results from the NFA 2018 Edition for the year 2014 indicate that humanity\&rsquo;s Ecological Footprint is 1.7 Earths, and that global ecological overshoot continues to grow. While improved management practices and increased agricultural yields have assisted in a steady increase of Earth\&rsquo;s biocapacity since 1961, humanity\&rsquo;s Ecological Footprint continues to increase at a faster pace than global biocapacity, particularly in Asia, where the total and per capita Ecological Footprint are increasing faster than all other regions.},

	abstract = {Concerns over energy security and climate change stimulate developments towards renewable energy. Transport is expected to switch from fossil fuel use to the use of fuel mixtures with a larger fraction of biofuels, e.g. bio-ethanol and biodiesel. Growing biomass for biofuels requires water, a scarce resource. Existing scenarios on freshwater use usually consider changes in food and livestock production, and industrial and domestic activities. This research assesses global water use changes related to increasing biofuel use for road transport in 2030 and evaluates the potential contribution to water scarcity. To investigate water demand changes related to a transition to biofuels in road transport, the study combines data from water footprint (WF) analyses with information from the IEA APS energy scenario for 2030. It includes first-generation biofuels, bio-ethanol from sugar cane, sugar beet, sweet sorghum, wheat and maize, and biodiesel from soybean, rapeseed, jatropha and oil palm. Under the IEA APS scenario, the global biofuel WF will increase more than tenfold in the period 2005–2030. The USA, China and Brazil together will contribute half of the global biofuel WF. In many countries, blue biofuel WFs significantly contribute to blue water scarcity. The research provides a first exploration of the potential contribution of transport biofuel use to blue water scarcity. In 2030, the global blue biofuel WF might have grown to 5.5\% of the totally available blue water for humans, causing extra pressure on fresh water resources. When biofuel use continues to expand after 2030, countries should therefore consider the water factor when investigating the extent to which biofuels can satisfy future transport energy demand.},

This study gives an overview of water footprints (WFs) of bioenergy from 12 crops that currently contribute the most to global agricultural production: barley, cassava, maize, potato, rapeseed, rice, rye, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, sugar cane, and wheat. In addition, this study includes jatropha, a suitable energy crop. Since climate and production circumstances differ among regions, calculations have been performed by country. The WF of bioelectricity is smaller than that of biofuels because it is more efficient to use total biomass (e.g., for electricity or heat) than a fraction of the crop (its sugar, starch, or oil content) for biofuel. The WF of bioethanol appears to be smaller than that of biodiesel. For electricity, sugar beet, maize, and sugar cane are the most favorable crops [50 m3/gigajoule (GJ)]. Rapeseed and jatropha, typical energy crops, are disadvantageous (400 m3/GJ). For ethanol, sugar beet, and potato (60 and 100 m3/GJ) are the most advantageous, followed by sugar cane (110 m3/GJ); sorghum (400 m3/GJ) is the most unfavorable. For biodiesel, soybean and rapeseed show to be the most favorable WF (400 m3/GJ); jatropha has an adverse WF (600 m3/GJ). When expressed per L, the WF ranges from 1,400 to 20,000 L of water per L of biofuel. If a shift toward a greater contribution of bioenergy to energy supply takes place, the results of this study can be used to select the crops and countries that produce bioenergy in the most water-efficient way.},

To evaluate the important impacts of biofuels on food security, the food-energy nexus needs to be investigated in the context of its linkages with the overall human appropriation of land and water resources. Here we provide a global assessment of biofuel crop production, reconstruct global patterns of biofuel crop/oil trade and determine the associated displacement of water and land use. We find that bioethanol is mostly produced with domestic crops while 36\% of biodiesel consumption relies on international trade, mainly from Southeast Asia. Altogether, biofuels rely on about 2-3\% of the global water and land used for agriculture, which could feed about 30\% of the malnourished population. We evaluate the food-energy tradeoff and the impact an increased reliance on biofuel would have on the number of people the planet can feed.},

	abstract = {Biofuels from microalgae are potentially important sources of liquid renewable energy. Algae are not yet produced on a large scale, but research shows promising results. This study assesses the blue water footprint (WF) and land use of algae-based biofuels. It combines the WF concept with an energy balance approach to determine the blue WF of net energy. The study considers open ponds and closed photobioreactors (PBRs). All systems have a positive energy balance, with output-input ratios ranging between 1.13 and 1.98. This study shows that the WF of algae-based biofuels lies between 8 and 193 m3/GJ net energy provided. The land use of microalgal biofuels ranges from 20 to 200 m2/GJ net energy. For a scenario in which algae-based biofuels provide 3.5\% of the transportation fuels in the European Union in 2030, the system with the highest land productivity needs 17,000 km2 to produce the 850 PJ/yr. Producing all algae-based biofuels through the system with the highest water productivity would lead to a blue WF of 7 Gm3/yr, which is equivalent to 15\% of the present blue WF in the EU28. A transition to algae-based transportation fuels will substantially increase competition over water and land resources.},

H2O and CO2 are converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuels using concentrated solar energy mediated by redox reactions of a metal oxide. Because attractive production locations are in arid regions, the water footprint and the land requirement of this fuel production pathway are analyzed. The water footprint consists of 7.4 liters per liter of jet fuel of direct demand on-site and 42.4 liters per liter of jet fuel of indirect demand, where the dominant contributions are the mining of the rare earth oxide ceria, the manufacturing of the solar concentration infrastructure, and the cleaning of the mirrors. The area-specific productivity is found to be 33 362 liters per hectare per year of jet fuel equivalents, where the land coverage is mainly due to the concentration of solar energy for heat and electricity. The water footprint and the land requirement of the solar thermochemical fuel pathway are larger than the best power-to-liquid pathways but an order of magnitude lower than the best biomass-to-liquid pathways. For the production of solar thermochemical fuels arid regions are best-suited, and for biofuels regions of a moderate and humid climate.},

	abstract = {Limiting warming to well below 2°C requires rapid and complete decarbonisation of energy systems. We compare economy-wide modelling of 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios with sector-focused analyses of four critical sectors that are difficult to decarbonise: aviation, shipping, road freight transport, and industry. We develop and apply a novel framework to analyse and track mitigation progress in these sectors. We find that emission reductions in the 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios of the IMAGE model come from deep cuts in CO2 intensities and lower energy intensities, with minimal demand reductions in these sectors’ activity. We identify a range of additional measures and policy levers that are not explicitly captured in modelled scenarios but could contribute significant emission reductions. These are demand reduction options, and include less air travel (aviation), reduced transportation of fossil fuels (shipping), more locally produced goods combined with high load factors (road freight), and a shift to a circular economy (industry). We discuss the challenges of reducing demand both for economy-wide modelling and for policy. Based on our sectoral analysis framework, we suggest modelling improvements and policy recommendations, calling on the relevant UN agencies to start tracking mitigation progress through monitoring key elements of the framework (CO2 intensity, energy efficiency, and demand for sectoral activity, as well as the underlying drivers), as a matter of urgency.Key policy insights Four critical sectors (aviation, shipping, road freight, and industry) cannot cut their CO2 emissions to zero rapidly with technological supply-side options alone. Without large-scale negative emissions, significant demand reductions for those sectors’ activities are needed to meet the 1.5–2°C goal.Policy priorities include affordable alternatives to frequent air travel; smooth connectivity between low-carbon travel modes; speed reductions in shipping and reduced demand for transporting fossil fuels; distributed manufacturing and local storage; and tightening standards for material use and product longevity.The COVID-19 crisis presents a unique opportunity to enact lasting CO2 emissions reductions, through switching from frequent air travel to other transport modes and online interactions.Policies driving significant demand reductions for the critical sectors’ activities would reduce reliance on carbon removal technologies that are unavailable at scale.},

	abstract = {Many climate change mitigation strategies rely on strong projected growth in biomass energy, supported by literature estimating high future bioenergy potential. However, expectations to 2050 are highly divergent. Examining the most widely cited studies finds that some assumptions in these models are inconsistent with the best available evidence. By identifying literature-supported, up-to-date assumptions for parameters including crop yields, land availability, and costs, we revise upper-end estimates of potential biomass availability from dedicated energy crops. Even allowing for the conversion of virtually all ‘unused’ grassland and savannah, we find that the maximum plausible limit to sustainable energy crop production in 2050 would be 40–110 EJ yr−1. Combined with forestry, crop residues, and wastes, the maximum limit to long-term total biomass availability is 60–120 EJ yr−1 in primary energy. After accounting for current trends in bioenergy allocation and conversion losses, we estimate maximum potentials of 10–20 EJ yr−1 of biofuel, 20–40 EJ yr−1 of electricity, and 10–30 EJ yr−1 of heating in 2050. These findings suggest that many technical projections and aspirational goals for future bioenergy use could be difficult or impossible to achieve sustainably.},

With the modified calculation model, energy savings as well as substitution potentials can be described. The examination of case studies where this model has been applied in energy planning led to the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the modified calculation model which are discussed subsequently. Hence it follows that the modified calculation model is suitable for energy planning processes from analysis to decision making. Used as a communication tool the model shows whether the principles of sustainable development are being realized on different levels of energy planning.},

	abstract = {"Prolegomena Commercial aviation has grown to become the backbone of the modern transport system. Demand for commercial air travel has grown exponentially since the 1960s. The expansion of the aviation services is set to increase further. Even in the worst moments of recession, air transport has only suffered a blip in its expansion. Our economy has become so dependent on air transport that any inconvenience caused by weather and external factors can cause mayhem. To understand the size of commercial aviation, reflect upon the fact that by the year 2000, there have been 35.14 million commercial departures worldwide, for a total of 18.14 million flight hours1. In some countries, air transport accounts for 1/4 of all transported goods by value. It is estimated that there are about 50,000 airports and airfields around the world2 and 18,000 commercial airplanes flying everyday. A number of large airports are being constructed in some rapidly expanding regions. Modern airports are the size of a city: London Heathrow covers about 12 km2; this is an area large enough to park about 1,800 Airbus A380 nose-to-tail. The support required by the aircraft is extraordinary, and involves engineering, logistics, integrated transport systems, security systems, energy and people. However, at the heart of everything is the aircraft itself, interpreted as a flight system: this is the subject of our book"--Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {In order to obtain bioenergy (biogas, biofuel) or pellets, different types of lignocellulosic biomass are subjected to a mechanical pretreatment, first by size reduction, then by separating, and ultimately by fracturing or bio-refining. Biomass processing mainly refers to a grinding process that occurs until reaching certain limits. The size reduction process, such as grinding, is an operation that is executed with different levels of energy consumption, considering biomass mechanical characteristics and the necessary grinding level. This paper, illustrates a comparative analysis of experimental results obtained by grinding multiple types of vegetal biomass (Miscanthus, corn stalks, alfalfa, willow) used in the process of bio-refining and bio-fracturing. Experiments were realized using both a laboratory knife mill Grindomix GM200 (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany), and a 22 kW articulated hammer mill, using different grinding system speeds and different hammer mill sieves. Results have shown that biomass mechanical pre-processing grinding leads to supplementary costs in the overall process through bio-refining or bio-fracturing in order to obtain bio-products or bio-energy. So, specific energy consumption for grinding using a hammer mill can reach 50–65 kJ/kg for harvested Miscanthus biomass, and 35–50 kJ/kg for dried energetic willow, using a 10 mm orifice sieve, values which increase processing costs.},

	abstract = {A techno-economic analysis was conducted to assess the feasibility of using forestry residues with different bark contents for bioethanol production. A proposed cellulosic ethanol biorefinery in Sweden was simulated with Aspen Plus. The plant was assumed to convert different forestry assortments (sawdust and shavings, fuel logs, early thinnings, tops and branches, hog fuel and pulpwood) to ethanol, pellets, biogas and electricity. The intention was not to obtain absolute ethanol production costs for future facilities, but to assess and compare the future potential of utilizing different forestry residues for bioethanol production. The same plant design and operating conditions were assumed in all cases, and the effect of including bark on the whole conversion process, especially how it influenced the ethanol production cost, was studied. While the energy efficiency (not including district heating) obtained for the whole process was between 67 and 69\% regardless of the raw material used, the ethanol production cost differed considerably; the minimum ethanol selling price ranging from 0.77 to 1.52USD/L. Under the basic assumptions, all the forestry residues apart from sawdust and shavings exhibited a negative net present value at current market prices. The profitability decreased with increasing bark content of the raw material. Sensitivity analyses showed that, at current market prices, the utilization of bark-containing forestry residues will not provide significant cost improvement compared with pulpwood unless the conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose to monomeric sugars is improved.},

The biomass feedstocks are mostly wet and need to be dried from 30 to 60 wt\% moisture content to about 10–15 wt\%. The present survey aims to define and evaluate a few of the most promising optimised concepts for biomass pre-treatment scheme in the production of second generation synfuels for transport. The most promising commercially available drying processes were reviewed, focusing on the applications, operational factors and emissions of dryers. The most common dryers applied now for biomass in bio-energy plants are direct rotary dryers, but the use of steam drying techniques is increasing. Steam drying systems enable the integration of the dryer to existing energy sources. In addition to integration, emissions and fire or explosion risks have to be considered when selecting a dryer for the plant. In steam drying there will be no gaseous emissions, but the aqueous effluents need often treatment. Concepts for biomass pre-treatment were defined for two different cases including a large-scale wood-based gasification synfuel production and a small-scale pyrolysis process based on wood chips and miscanthus bundles. For the first case a pneumatic conveying steam dryer was suggested. In the second case the flue gas will be used as drying medium in a direct or indirect rotary dryer.},

An LCA of rapeseed oil produced by cold pressing was carried out. The environmental impact assessment was calculated with the ReCiPe impact assessment method version 1.03, a hierarchical (H) perspective, along with the cumulative energy demand method v1.11. Cultivation of winter rapeseed has a lower environmental impact than cultivation of spring rapeseed due to higher agricultural inputs and higher yield. The greatest impact is on human health. Mineral fertilizers (production and application) and agricultural machinery are responsible for the greatest environmental impact. The results for the mill stage of rapeseed oil demonstrated that the choice of the allocation method has a significant impact on the environmental performance results.},

The assessment improves upon earlier research by taking a high-resolution approach, estimating the water footprint of 126 crops at a 5 by 5 arc minute grid. We have used a grid-based dynamic water balance model to calculate crop water use over time, with a time step of one day. The model takes into account the daily soil water balance and climatic conditions for each grid cell. In addition, the water pollution associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizer in crop production is estimated for each grid cell. The crop evapotranspiration of additional 20 minor crops is calculated with the CROPWAT model. In addition, we have calculated the water footprint of more than two hundred derived crop products, including various flours, beverages, fibres and biofuels. We have used the water footprint assessment framework as in the guideline of the Water Footprint Network. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Considering the water footprints of primary crops, we see that the global average water footprint per ton of crop increases from sugar crops (roughly 200 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ ton$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), vegetables (300 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ ton$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), roots and tubers (400 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ ton$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), fruits (1000 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ ton$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), cereals (1600 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ ton$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), oil crops (2400 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ ton$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) to pulses (4000 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ ton$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$). The water footprint varies, however, across different crops per crop category and per production region as well. Besides, if one considers the water footprint per kcal, the picture changes as well. When considered per ton of product, commodities with relatively large water footprints are: coffee, tea, cocoa, tobacco, spices, nuts, rubber and fibres. The analysis of water footprints of different biofuels shows that bio-ethanol has a lower water footprint (in m$^{\textrm{3}}$ GJ$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) than biodiesel, which supports earlier analyses. The crop used matters significantly as well: the global average water footprint of bio-ethanol based on sugar beet amounts to 51 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ GJ$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$, while this is 121 m$^{\textrm{3}}$ GJ$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ for maize. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The global water footprint related to crop production in the period 1996–2005 was 7404 billion cubic meters per year (78 \% green, 12 \% blue, 10 \% grey). A large total water footprint was calculated for wheat (1087 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), rice (992 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) and maize (770 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$). Wheat and rice have the largest blue water footprints, together accounting for 45 \% of the global blue water footprint. At country level, the total water footprint was largest for India (1047 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$), China (967 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) and the USA (826 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$). A relatively large total blue water footprint as a result of crop production is observed in the Indus river basin (117 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) and the Ganges river basin (108 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$). The two basins together account for 25 \% of the blue water footprint related to global crop production. Globally, rain-fed agriculture has a water footprint of 5173 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ (91 \% green, 9 \% grey); irrigated agriculture has a water footprint of 2230 Gm$^{\textrm{3}}$ yr$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$ (48 \% green, 40 \% blue, 12 \% grey).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The introduction of rapeseed, the correctness of its conversion to obtain straight vegetable oil and its use as self-consumption biofuel in tractors are evaluated. Life cycle assessment is used in this work to evaluate the impacts of different considered scenarios. A sensitivity analysis has also been conducted. The results presented show a modest environmental improvement (diminishment of 6 out of the 10 analyzed environmental impacts) when introducing rapeseed to local crop rotations and its partial conversion to oil to be used as fuel in existing diesel engines. Additionally, the ratio between the energy obtained and the total energy input shows moderate positive results when comparing the latter case with the current one. Results from this study can be used to support research and decision making to assess the convenience of introducing alternative fuels in agricultural exploitations.},

	abstract = {Growing energy needs and medium-term weakening of fossil energy reserves are driving forces towards the exploitation of alternative and renewable energy sources, such as biofuels from energy crops. In recent years, Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz has been rediscovered and is gaining popularity worldwide. The present work reports the results of a study on the life cycle, from cradle-to-gate, of C. sativa oil as a raw material for the production of biofuels in northern Italy, considering two scenarios, namely, the production of biodiesel (BD) and the extraction of pure vegetable oil (PVO). The functional unit was 1 megajoule of biofuel. A life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) was calculated according to the ILCD2011 procedure. Focusing on the global warming potential, the PVO scenario performs better than the BD scenario, with around 30 g CO2eq MJ\&minus;1. The net energy ratio (NER) exceeds unity for BD (approximately 1.4) or PVO (approximately 2.5). The same general trend was recorded for all calculated LCIA indicators; the common evidence is a generalized worse performance of the BD scenario, with indicators always scoring higher than the PVO. In particular, the two human toxicity indicators\&mdash;carcinogenic and fresh water\&mdash;eutrophication represent a significant difference, attributable to the refining process. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, respectively, underline the generalized importance of agricultural performances in the field and of allocation choices. Specifically, the importance of the grain yield and seed oil content in determining the environmental performance of the two scenarios was evident. As far as allocation is concerned, mass allocation provides the most favorable results, while on the other hand, the expansion of the system was the most penalizing alternative.},

Seven C. sativa genotypes were tested and compared with rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). The main phenological stages and biometric traits were recorded, along with seed yield. In general, camelina showed a seed yield similar to that of rapeseed cultivated in the same locality and in the last decade in Italy. On average, the grain yields of camelina and rapeseed grown in the same location and conditions were {\textasciitilde}1340 and 1625 kg ha–1, respectively. The agronomic performance of camelina varied, with climatic events having a greater effect than sowing season or genotypes. Among the investigated genotypes, however, C. sativa accession CAM 40 was the most adaptable to unfavourable environmental conditions and CAM 172 to favourable conditions. With regard to the two sowing seasons, autumn planting allowed for better performance than spring planting during the second cultivation year. The phenotypic plasticity of camelina was estimated for the first time in the present work. Branching capability was the most plastic trait under favourable yielding conditions. Among the tested genotypes, CAM 40 showed limited yield plasticity and CAM 172 demonstrated high plasticity for the same trait, offering a greater potential for future genetic improvement.},

We analyzed 405 river basins for the period 1996–2005. In 201 basins with 2.67 billion inhabitants there was severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. The ecological and economic consequences of increasing degrees of water scarcity – as evidenced by the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo), Indus, and Murray-Darling River Basins – can include complete desiccation during dry seasons, decimation of aquatic biodiversity, and substantial economic disruption.},

	abstract = {Eddy covariance measurements were made in seven ﬁelds in the Midwest USA over 4 years (including the 2012 drought year) to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) of newly established rain-fed cellulosic and grain biofuel crops. Four of the converted ﬁelds had been managed as grasslands under the USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) for 22 years, and three had been in conventional agriculture (AGR) soybean/corn rotation prior to conversion. In 2009, all sites were planted to no-till soybean except one CRP grassland that was left unchanged as a reference site; in 2010, three of the former CRP sites and the three former AGR sites were planted to annual (corn) and perennial (switchgrass and mixed-prairie) grasslands. The annual ET over the 4 years ranged from 45\% to 77\% (mean = 60\%) of the annual precipitation (848–1063 mm; November–October), with the unconverted CRP grassland having the highest ET (622–706 mm). In the ﬁelds converted to annual and perennial crops, the annual ET ranged between 480 and 639 mm despite the large variations in growing-season precipitation and in soil water contents, which had strong effects on regional crop yields. Results suggest that in this humid temperate climate, which represents the US Corn Belt, water use by annual and perennial crops is not greatly different across years with highly variable precipitation and soil water availability. Therefore, largescale conversion of row crops to perennial biofuel cropping systems may not strongly alter terrestrial water balances.},

Evapotranspiration (ET, the combination of plant and ground surface transpiration and evaporation) forms an important part of the water balance, and few ET models have been tested with Miscanthus. Therefore, this study uses field measurements to determine the most accurate ET model and to establish the interception of precipitation by the canopy (Ci). Daily ET estimates from 2012 to 2016 using the Hargreaves–Samani, Priestley–Taylor, Granger–Gray, and Penman–Monteith (short grass) models were calculated using data from a weather station situated in a 6 ha Miscanthus crop. Results from these models were compared to data from on-site eddy covariance (EC) instrumentation to determine accuracy and calculate the crop coefficient (Kc) model parameter. Ci was measured from June 2016 to March 2017 using stem-flow and through-flow gauges within the crop and rain gauges outside the crop. The closest estimated ET to the EC data was the Penman-Monteith (short grass) model. The Kc values proposed are 0.63 for the early season (March and April), 0.85 for the main growing season (May to September), 1.57 for the late growing season (October and November), and 1.12 over the winter (December to February). These more accurate Kc values will enable better ET estimates with the use of the Penman-Monteith (short grass) model improving estimates of potential yields and hydrological impacts of land use change. Ci was 24\% and remained high during the autumn and winter thereby sustaining significant levels of canopy evaporation and suggesting benefits for winter flood mitigation.},

Juvenile and mature Miscanthus × giganteus crops of varying age are surveyed in growers’ fields across mid-England. We record in-field plant density counts and the morphology of crops of different ages. Mature crops thrive on both clay and sandy soils. Plants surveyed appear robust to drought, weeds and disease, the only vulnerability is rhizome condition when planting. Mature miscanthus planted pre-2014 continues to develop, spreading into planting gaps and growing more tillers. In stands planted post-2014, improved planting techniques reduce planting gaps and create a reasonably consistent planting density of 12,500 plants/ha. The main reason for growers' investment in miscanthus is not financial return, but relates to its low requirement for field operations, low maintenance cost and regeneration. This offers practical solutions for difficult field access and social acceptability near public places (related to spray operations and crop vandalism). Wildlife is abundant in these fields, largely undisturbed except for harvest. This contributes to the greening of agriculture; fields are also used for gamebird cover and educational tours. This crop is solving practical problems for growers while improving the environment. Observed yield data indicate gradual yield increase with crop age, a yield plateau but no yield decrease since 2006. In stands with low planting densities, yields plateau after 9 years. Surveyed yield data are used to parameterize the MiscanFor bioenergy model. This produces options to simulate either juvenile yields or a yield for a landscape containing different aged crops. For mature English crop yields of 12 t ha−1 year−1, second- and third-year juvenile harvests average 7 t ha−1 year−1 and a surrounding 10 km by 10 km area of distributed crop age would average 9 t ha−1 year−1.},

	abstract = {Fermentation and advanced fermentation (AF) biofuel production technologies may offer a means to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of transportation by providing renewable drop-in alternatives to conventional middle distillate (MD) fuels, including diesel and jet fuel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first peer-reviewed study of the environmental and economic feasibility of AF technologies. We find that the attributional lifecycle GHG footprint of AF MD from sugar cane, corn grain and switchgrass ranges from −27.0 to 19.7, 47.5 to 117.5, and 11.7 to 89.8 gCO2e/MJMD, respectively, compared to 90.0 gCO2e/MJMD for conventional MD. These results are most sensitive to the co-product allocation method used, the efficiency and utility requirements of feedstock-to-fuel conversion, and the co-generation technology employed. We also calculate the minimum selling price (MSP) of MD fuel produced from sugar cane, corn grain and switchgrass AF as a range from 0.61 to 2.63, 0.84 to 3.65, and 1.09 to 6.30 \$ per literMD, respectively, compared to the current price of conventional MD in the United States of approximately 0.80 \$ per literMD. The MSP results are most sensitive to feedstock-to-fuel conversion efficiency, feedstock costs, and capital costs. Finally, we demonstrate that emissions from land use change (LUC) directly attributable to the growth of biomass for AF fuel could dominate the GHG footprint of AF MD fuels.},

Net energy consumption, production cost and emission are estimated considering three scenarios (S1: all classes of land; S2: prime land; S3: marginal land, are used for miscanthus cultivation). Depending on the scenarios net energy consumption, production cost and emissions are found to be varied from 12.1 to 12.5 GJ m−3, 776.7 to 811.3\$ m−3 and 0.7 to 1.3 t-CO2e m−3, respectively. Although energy consumption and production cost is slightly varied among the scenarios, the variation seems to be robust in the case of GHG emissions, where carbon dynamics play an important role. This study revealed that miscanthus is a promising feedstock for ethanol even if it is grown on marginal land which may abate competition with food crops and improve the farm economy in Ontario, Canada.},

Even though water is an important aspect of the environmental impact, the impact assessment of hydrogen production on water is lacking. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for assessing the water footprints of hydrogen production from electrolysis. A major innovative aspect is to demonstrate the geographical distribution of the footprints along the supply chain. The water footprints for hydrogen produced from grid electricity, wind and solar power in Australia was analysed as a case study. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the influence of key parameters including Solar Radiation Level, Silicon Efficiency, and Lifetime of PV Modules. The study finds that the water consumption footprint is much less than that reported in the literature and large part of the water could be consumed indirectly outside of hydrogen producing countries. The quantity of water footprint varies significantly among different assumptions. The findings provide insights into both domestic and cross-boundary water impacts of hydrogen electrolysis and can thus inform policy debates in each nation and beyond.},

The WF of electricity and heat from firewood increased four times, and the WF of hydropower grew by 23\%. The sector's WF can be most effectively reduced by shifting to greater contributions of wind, PV and geothermal energy.},

However, some life-cycle assessments (LCAs) have shown that HEFA diesel and jet fuel may have higher life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than the fossil fuels they replace. Many of these studies examined HEFA fuel derived from oilseed feedstocks. Here, results and methodology from 20 LCAs of HEFA fuel from oilseeds are reviewed in an effort to determine the sources of variability in the reported life-cycle GHG emissions of HEFA fuels. Although there was a 61–63\% reduction in median life cycle GHG emissions of HEFA biojet and renewable diesel compared to conventional petroleum fuels, this review highlights the importance of standardized methodologies for life-cycle assessment (e.g., CORSIA, RSB) and indicates the need to prevent the conversion of forest land for biofuel production, as well as the potential opportunity for alternative oilseeds such as camelina and carinata as feedstocks to produce HEFA fuels with lower life-cycle GHG emissions. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {We quantify energy return on energy investment (EROI) as one metric for the sustainability of alternative jet fuel production. Lifecycle energy requirements are calculated and subsequently used for calculating three EROI variants. EROI1 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to lifecycle (direct and indirect) fossil fuel energy inputs, excluding the energy content of fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. EROI2 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to total fossil fuel energy inputs, including the energy content of fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. EROI3 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to lifecycle (direct and indirect) fossil and non-fossil energy inputs, excluding the energy content of fossil and non-fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. We also define an approximation for EROI1 using lifecycle CO2 emissions. This approach agrees to within 20\% of the actual EROI1 and can be used as an alternative when necessary. The feedstock-to-fuel pathways considered include conventional jet fuel from crude oil; Fischer–Tropsch jet (FT-J) fuel from natural gas (NG), coal and/or switchgrass; hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids jet (HEFA-J) fuel from soybean, palm, rapeseed and jatropha; and advanced fermentation jet (AF-J) fuel from sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass. We find that EROI1 for jet fuel from conventional crude oil ranges between 4.9 and 14.0. Among the alternative fuel pathways considered, FT-J fuel from switchgrass has the highest baseline EROI1 of 9.8, followed by AF-J fuel from sugarcane at 6.7. HEFA-J fuel from oily feedstocks has an EROI1 between 1.6 (rapeseed) and 2.9 (palm). EROI2 differs from EROI1 only in the case of fossil-based jet fuels. Conventional jet from crude oil has a baseline EROI2 of 0.9, and FT-J fuel from NG and coal have values of 0.6 and 0.5, respectively. EROI3 values are on average 36\% less than EROI1 for HEFA-J pathways. EROI3 for the AF-J and FT-J fuels considered is 50\% less than EROI1 on average. All alternative fuels considered have a lower baseline EROI3 than conventional jet fuel.},

With the increased interest in a hydrogen (H2) economy, the life-cycle environmental performance of H2 production has special significance for assisting in identifying opportunities to improve environmental performance and to guide challenging decisions and select between technology paths. Life cycle impact assessment methods are rapidly evolving to analyze multiple environmental impacts of the production of products or processes. This study marks the first step in developing process-based streamlined life cycle analysis (LCA) of several H2 production pathways combining life cycle impacts at the midpoint (17 problem-oriented) and endpoint (3 damage-oriented) levels using the state-of-the-art impact assessment method ReCiPe 2016. Steam reforming of natural gas, coal gasification, water electrolysis via proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM), solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC), biomass gasification and reforming, and dark fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass were analyzed. An innovative aspect is developed in this study is an analysis of water consumption associated with H2 production pathways by life-cycle stage to provide a better understanding of the life cycle water-related impacts on human health and natural environment. For water-related scope, Water scarcity footprint (WSF) quantified using Available WAter REmaining (AWARE) method was applied as a stand-alone indicator. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each production pathway, identify the drivers of environmental impact, quantify midpoint environmental impact and its influence on the endpoint environmental performance. The findings of this study could serve as a useful theoretical reference and practical basis to decision-makers of potential environmental impacts of H2 production systems.},

A categorization index (with unique category codes, formatted as ‘axis of rotation-installed location-power generation capacity’) was adopted for use in this study to characterize the reviewed wind electricity generation systems. The unique category codes were labeled by integrating the names from the three wind power sub-classifications, i.e., the axis of rotation of the wind turbine [horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT)], the location of the installation [onshore (ON), offshore (OFF)], and the electricity production capacity [small (S), intermediate (I), large (L)]. The characterized wind electricity generation systems were statistically evaluated to assess the reduction in life cycle GHG emissions. A total of five unique categorization codes (HAWT-ON-S, HAWT-ON-I, HAWT-ON-L, HAWT-OFF-L, VAWT-ON-S) were designated to the 29 wind electricity generation LCA studies (representing 74 wind system cases) using the proposed categorization index. The mean life cycle GHG emissions resulting from the use of HAWT-ON-S (N = 3), HAWT-ON-I (N = 4), HAWT-ON-L (N = 58), HAWT-OFF-L (N = 8), and VAWT-ON-S (N = 1) wind electricity generation systems are 38.67, 11.75, 15.98, 12.9, and 46.4 gCO2e/kWh, respectively.

The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1259855
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.
RATIONALE The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).
RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).
CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6223/1259855/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.
The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.
Developments in the planetary boundaries concept provide a framework to support global sustainability.

We consider plausible developments in the subtechnology markets for lithium-ion batteries, wind power, and electric motors for road transport. Moreover, we include the uncertainties regarding the specific material content of these subtechnologies and the reserve and resource estimates. Furthermore, the development of the material demand in non-energy sectors is considered. The results show that the material requirements increase with the degree of ambition of the scenarios. The maximum annual primary material demand of the scenarios exceeds current extraction volumes by a factor of 3 to 9 (Nd), 7 to 35 (Dy), 12 to 143 (Li), and 2 to 22 (Co). The ratios of cumulative primary material demand to average reserve estimates range from 0.1 to 0.3 (Nd), 0.3 to 1.1 (Dy), 0.7 to 6.5 (Li), and 0.8 to 5.5 (Co). Average resource estimates of Li and Co are exceeded by up to a factor of 2.1 and 1.7, respectively. We recommend that future scenario studies on the energy system transformation consider the influence of possible material bottlenecks on technology prices and substitution technology options.},

Electricity production contributes 90\% to the total WF, and heat contributes 10\%. In 2012, the global WF of electricity and heat was 1.8 times larger than that in 2000. The WF of electricity and heat from firewood increased four times, and the WF of hydropower grew by 23\%. The sector's WF can be most effectively reduced by shifting to greater contributions of wind, PV and geothermal energy.},

The so-called nexus approaches have shown their usefulness in assessing strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in the contexts of increasing demands, resource scarcity, and climate change. However, most nexus analyses omit some important inter-linkages that could actually be addressed. The omissions often stem from technical and practical considerations, but also from limited dissemination of new open-source frameworks incorporating recent advances. We review and present a set of models that can meet the needs of decision makers for analysis tools capable of addressing a broad range of nexus questions. Particular attention is given to model accessibility, usability and community support. The other objective of this review is to discuss research gaps, and critical needs and opportunities for further model development from a scientific viewpoint. We explore at different scales where and why some nexus interactions are most relevant. We find that both very small scale and global models tend to neglect some CLEW interactions, but for different reasons. The former rarely include climate impacts, which are often marginal at the local level, while the latter mostly lack some aspects because of the complexity of large full CLEW systems at the global level.},
